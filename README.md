First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/fayiztv/Reactmachinetask.git,
   cd Reactmachinetask,
# Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

cd client 
npm install

Do the same for the backend:

# Running the Application
Start the Backend Server

In the backend directory, start the server:
